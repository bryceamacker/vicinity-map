This project is meant to create a vector image (SVG) of the roads and road names selected from a map.

The project is built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

The project is styled with Tailwind CSS.

The user first finds an area on the map that they want to select. When they are centered on the area, they select 'Export'.
The brings up a new Export window with a list of roads to select. Once they select the roads they want to include, they select 'Export'.

The Export window should show an image of the roads as they are selected/unselected. The Export window should only show the section of the map that is currently visible in the map window. Any roads that are not visible should not be shown in the Export window.
